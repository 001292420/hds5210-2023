# Week 4 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.


## Final Score: 9/10

## Multiple Choice:
_Did you complete and submit the multiple choice part of the assignment?_
* Complete

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* All code worked as expected

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
  * **(-1) 20.1 Using i and j as iterator names is sometimes OK, but in this scenario, I think you needed to be clear about what i and j are.  It makes logic like `if i in j` very hard to understand.**
  * **Similar comment on your use of one-letter iterator variable names throughout.  Please use something that makes it clear what the variable represents.**
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
  * **20.1 No points off, but your process for pulling out last names, sorting, and then iterating through the sorted names and the original names is pretty inefficient.  I appreciate your thought process and creative approach, though!**
  * **20.3 Similar to the note above, your process is not the most efficient, but it does work.**
