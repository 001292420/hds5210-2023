Through the project's early risk identification capabilities, individualized care plans, and improved post-discharge follow-up, patient care is improved. Healthcare providers can improve the patient experience by addressing readmission causing factors and implementing preventive interventions. The data-driven methodology of the project facilitates risk assessment, well-informed decision-making, and regulatory compliance particularly in healthcare systems where high readmission rates carry penalties. It ensures that resources are available for those in need and helps to reduce hospital overcrowding.Furthermore, ongoing readmission rate monitoring promotes a culture of quality improvement since the data it generates helps to inform ongoing research aimed at improving predictive models and discovering new readmission-influencing factors.\n"
