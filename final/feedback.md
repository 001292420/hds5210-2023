The grading rubric for the final can be found in GitHub: https://github.com/paulboal/hds5210-2023/blob/main/final/final-instructions.pdf

**Functional Requirements**
* 5 points - Uses data from at least two different sources: local file, internet, web service, relational database, AWS S3, etc; and formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc
* 5 points - Data from multiple sources has to be joined together at least twice
* 5 points - Data is aggregated or pivoted at least twice during the program
* 5 points - Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times
* 5 points - The program creates 3 or more data visualizations 
* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.

**Great up front explanation.  You laid out what your goals were and how the project would proceed very nicely.**

**I like the couple of functions you created.  Well documented, too.  Remember to create a few doctests, though, to make sure your code can be easily tested and will be reliable.**

**(-1) Variable names like `df_merged1` don't help us understand what the nature of the underlying data are.  Yes, they're merged.  But, why? What for? Which data?**

**(-1) I think you included all of the requirements, but it did get a littel tough to follow your work near the end.  It almost feels like you didn't quite conclude the project.  I would have expected to see a conclusion at the end.**
